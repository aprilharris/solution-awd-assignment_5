# Assignment 5: For Loops Practice
### Challenge 1:
Notice the provided jQuery code on line 9 in your script.js file that appends one image from the array photos. 
Using that as an example, write a jQuery line of code for each of the remaining images in the array photos.

### Challenge 2: 
The future of tech is in danger! You must use a **for of loop** to assemble the Avengers and save America On Tech and its students!
Use your knowledge of for loops to summon the galaxy's mightiest heroes to fight off the villainous Thanos and his quest to conquer your future!

**Step 1:** 
Inside the provided click handler, write a for of loop that will iterate over the avengerPics array and display each image. You will need to find the images to include in the array.
**Step 2:** 
Add additional images to the avengerPics array of your favorite superheros! Did the image display without modifying any of the for of loops?
**Step 3:** 
Create a new array called avengerNames with the names of the Avengers and create a new for of loop to iterate over this array and display each name in a paragraph tag.

BONUS:
Can you display each Avenger's name under their picture?
